Translation application that can help you to enlarge your vocabulary.
It consist of three main parts:
-[x]Google Chrome extension;
-[x]Server side (Node.js, Express, Postgres, Sequelize);
-[x]Client side (Backbone.js).
I also used Google Translate API and Google TTS.

Issues:
-[x]Now tts works only for English.

TODO:
-[ ]Solve the problem with tts: find a way to convert text to speech or remove speaker signs for other languages.
-[ ]Refactor the client side code to use Backbone for communications with server.
